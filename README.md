I am an avid collector of physical media. 

The benefits of listening to music on vinyl vs CD vs .mp3 continue to be debated,
but the contest between VHS and DVD, or DVD and Blu-ray has long been settled.

Still, without rhyme or reason, I love my collection of VHS tapes and albums on cassette.

This is an app that will help users track their collection of media.

Whether you are a collector like me, or you just want to avoid buying the same thing twice-
This app will help us both.

This app tracks movies, shows, music, video games, and books-
with the ability to select which format the content is in.
